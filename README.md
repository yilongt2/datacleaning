This project is for the IS 537 data cleaning project for the learning purpose

Thanks for your time to check my data work here. I organized these three main parts in different files since I used three different combined softwares to do this job.

PART 1 Publicly-Listed Banks

	-I used tableau prep to clean the data in order to clean the data source and join the different table. Then, I checked the simliar rows to eliminate typos, which is very common. W hile we conduct research but actually it has typos in countries, finally I create the field named as master file.

	-Then I used tableau to draw the visual, which is much simple than R code to draw ggplot, and simple for viewers. 

PART 2 Conceptual Reasoning (No data)
	- Since it's a differencing method in the statistics, I had some explain the reason in the master file
